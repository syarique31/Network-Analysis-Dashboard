# Network-Analysis-Dashboard
When I first set out to get hands-on experience with Splunk, I didn’t quite know what I was getting myself into. As a cybersecurity intern, I’ve always been curious about the tools that SOC analysts rely on day to day, and Splunk consistently came up in conversations. Around that time, I was even considering another internship opportunity that focused almost entirely on Splunk. That made me even more curious about what made this platform such a big deal in the security world. Everyone described it as a “must-know” tool for analyzing logs, monitoring network traffic, and spotting anomalies that could indicate malicious activity. To me, that sounded like the perfect opportunity to learn how professionals actually dig into data to detect threats across systems, networks, and servers.

But opening Splunk for the first time was… overwhelming. The interface was full of dashboards, search bars, and menus I didn’t understand. I remember staring at the home screen and thinking, “Okay, now what?” That’s when I turned to YouTube. I found an introductory walkthrough that explained Splunk in a way that finally clicked: Splunk Enterprise is essentially the brain of the operation — the central hub where all your data gets indexed, stored, and made searchable. Everything else revolves around feeding that brain with fresh data so it can be analyzed.
